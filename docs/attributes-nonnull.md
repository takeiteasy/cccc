# Nonnull Attributes

`nonnull` and `returns_nonnull` checking.

## `__attribute__((nonnull))` / `__attribute__((nonnull(N,...)))` / `[[gnu::nonnull]]` and `__attribute__((returns_nonnull))` / `[[gnu::returns_nonnull]]`

Marks pointer parameters (bare `nonnull`, or `nonnull(1,3)` for specific
1-based argument indices) as never null, and `returns_nonnull` marks a
function's return value as never null. Both are static, compile-time-only
checks — there is no codegen effect.

At each call site, an argument in a nonnull position (or a `return` in a
`returns_nonnull` function) is checked in two ways:

- A **compile-time constant** that folds to zero, e.g. a literal
  `NULL`/`0`/`(void*)0`, is always caught.
- A light **flow-sensitive pass** additionally tracks simple local pointer
  variables through straight-line code within a single function body, so a
  null value that reaches the call through a variable is also caught:

```c
void handle(int *p) __attribute__((nonnull(1)));
void handle(int *p) { *p = 1; }

int *make(void) __attribute__((returns_nonnull));
int *make(void) { return 0; }   // warns: null returned from function declared with 'returns_nonnull'

int main(void) {
    handle(0);                  // warns: null passed to a parameter marked nonnull (parameter 1)

    int *p = 0;
    handle(p);                  // warns: null value passed to a parameter marked nonnull (parameter 1)

    make();
    return 42;
}
```

Under plain `-Wnonnull`, the flow pass only warns on **provably-null**
values — a pointer whose address has been taken is never tracked.

A pointer that is only **maybe** null — definitely null on one path through
a branch but not on all of them, e.g.:

```c
int *p = 0;
if (cond) p = &x;
handle(p);   // -Wnonnull: silent; -Wmaybe-nonnull: warns
```

is diagnosed separately under the opt-in `-Wmaybe-nonnull`, via real
dataflow: each live branch of an `if`/ternary/`&&`/`||` is walked
independently and the resulting null-states are joined at the merge point;
a `for`/`while`/`do` loop is walked as a bounded back-edge fixpoint (a
handful of iterations is always enough to converge, given the null-state
lattice's small height), with every `break`/`continue` site's state tracked
separately and joined in at the loop's exit/header respectively — a
`do`-loop's exit correctly excludes the zero-trip case, since its body
always runs at least once; a `switch` is a single pass with no fixpoint
needed, where each `case` label joins the switch's entry state into the
fall-through state (so `case 0: p = 0; /* fall */ case 1: use(p);` reports
maybe-null at `case 1`, matching real per-case dispatch), `break` states are
joined into the exit, and — when there's no `default` — the pre-switch state
is *also* a live exit predecessor, since the whole switch is then skippable.
This applies to `-Wnonnull` too, not just `-Wmaybe-nonnull`: a loop/switch
that is provably null on every live path (no conditional branch involved)
now warns under plain `-Wnonnull`, where it previously fell back to the
conservative "reset to unknown on exit" scheme and stayed silent. A
construct the fixpoint/join scheme can't safely model — a `goto`/label
anywhere inside it (a jump target from an unknown predecessor), a computed
goto, or a `case` label reachable from a loop body without an intervening
`switch` of its own (Duff's device) — falls back to that original
conservative scheme instead, which can only miss a warning, never fabricate
one. `-Wmaybe-nonnull` has a higher false-positive rate on real code than
plain `-Wnonnull` regardless, so it is never implied by `-Wall` or
`-Wextra` — pass it explicitly.

A limited form of **interprocedural** tracking also feeds the same
`-Wmaybe-nonnull` lattice: a whole-translation-unit pass flags any
pointer-returning function that has a provable null-returning path (a
literal `return 0;`/`return NULL;` on some reachable branch), regardless of
where in the file it's defined relative to its callers. A direct call to a
flagged function, assigned to a local, is treated as maybe-null:

```c
int *maybe_null(int cond) { return cond ? &x : 0; }

void use(void) {
    int *p = maybe_null(1);
    handle(p);   // -Wmaybe-nonnull: warns; maybe_null() may return null
}
```

This is deliberately conservative in the safe direction: only a function
with a **visible body** in the current translation unit and a **provable**
null-returning path is flagged — an unannotated external or
declaration-only function (e.g. `malloc`) is never assumed to maybe-return
null, since that would warn on nearly every unannotated pointer-returning
call. It propagates through a direct call to a flagged function whether that
call is first assigned to a local or used inline as the argument/return
expression itself:

```c
handle(maybe_null(1));               // -Wmaybe-nonnull: warns, same as above

int *wrap(void) __attribute__((returns_nonnull));
int *wrap(void) { return maybe_null(1); }   // -Wmaybe-nonnull: warns
```

A transitive call chain — a function whose *only* null-returning path is
itself a call to another flagged function (`return other_maybe_null_fn();`,
as opposed to a literal `return 0;`) — is also covered: the summary pass
iterates to a fixpoint, so chains of any depth converge regardless of source
order:

```c
int *relay(int cond) { return maybe_null(cond); }  // relay flagged too, transitively

void use(void) {
    int *p = relay(1);
    handle(p);   // -Wmaybe-nonnull: warns
}
```

When a flagged function is provably null on **every** reachable path (never
just some), the whole-TU pass promotes it from a maybe-null fact to a
definite one — mirroring the same NN_NULL-vs-NN_MAYBE distinction the
intra-function flow analysis already makes for local variables:

```c
int *always_null(void) { return 0; }

void use(void) {
    int *p = always_null();
    handle(p);   // -Wnonnull: warns (needs -Wmaybe-nonnull passed too, to
                 // run the interprocedural pass that discovers the fact)
}
```

Note this still requires `-Wmaybe-nonnull` to be passed for the
interprocedural pass to run at all — the always-null fact is diagnosed
under `-Wnonnull`'s message text once discovered, but discovering it in the
first place stays gated behind the opt-in flag, same as every other
interprocedural fact here. Passing `-Wmaybe-nonnull` alone (without
`-Wnonnull`) does **not** warn on an always-null callee, again mirroring the
local-variable convention: `-Wmaybe-nonnull` covers *maybe*-null evidence,
and a provably-always-null value is `-Wnonnull`'s concern.

Diagnosed under `-Wnonnull` (part of `-Wall`) and `-Wmaybe-nonnull`
(opt-in only); disable with `-Wno-nonnull` / `-Wno-maybe-nonnull`.

**`__has_attribute`:** returns `1` for `nonnull`, `__nonnull__`,
`returns_nonnull`, and `__returns_nonnull__`.
