# Changelog

All notable changes to CCCC are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Version history
before the 0.1.0 reset is not relisted here — see the ticket tracker and
`git log` for the historical record.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-11

- Inline build recipes and tests alongside `main()`: a single `.c` file can
  now carry `main()`, `[[cccc::test]]` functions, and a
  `[[cccc::build]]`/`[[cccc::build_target]]` recipe together, each invoked
  by its own flag (`cccc`, `cccc --testing`, `cccc --build`). `--build` no
  longer rejects a script for defining `main()`; a file with
  `[[cccc::build_target]]` factories and no entry now runs all of them
  automatically under `--build`.
- New `--no-emit-tests` flag: drops `[[cccc::test]]` bodies from
  `-c=native`/`-c=generated` output entirely, instead of emitting them
  inert.
- `RunCustom` build-script shell: builtins now honour redirects and pipes,
  the last same-direction redirect wins, pipe file descriptors are
  `CLOEXEC`, multi-redirect and `$(...)` command substitution work, and a
  pipeline no longer leaks write-end file descriptors or deadlocks.
- `#if`/`#ifdef` `defined()`/`__has_*` operators are now recognized when
  revealed by macro expansion, not only in the raw source text; an
  unrecognized `__has_*` operator now gets its own diagnostic.
- `--sysroot` now resolves the correct multiarch include directory, and
  `asm-label`/attribute ordering under `--sysroot` is fixed.
- `sys/statvfs.h` gets a real-header hand-off (closing out the
  self-hosting type-shadowing audit).
- A URL `#include` now mirrors nested project-header includes it reaches,
  and its default cache directory is resolved before `--url-cache-clear`
  checks for one.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-06
